# U-Grub

U-Grub is a web app that allows you to be your own restaurant critic or simply keep track of your restaurant experience. U-Grub also allows you to search for restaurants wherever you are anywhere in the world with a simple push of a button.



> The goal for U-Grub is to allow you, the user, to
> record your restaurant experience and later recall
> the things you liked, didn't like, food you ate and more.
> If you are traveling no worries, we have you covered
> there also. Simply go the the Search Local Eateries tab
> and type in your location and you will be given a list
> of local restaurants with all the information you will
> need to determine the best place to eat.
